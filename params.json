No per-account setup is\r\nrequired! Mailboxes are created on the fly as mail is received for them, and\r\nno password is required to browse the content of the mailboxes.\r\n\r\nInbucket has a built-in SMTP server and stores incoming mail as flat files on\r\ndisk - no external SMTP or database daemons required.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------\r\n![Screenshot 1](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jhillyerd/inbucket/inbucket-ss1.png)\r\n\r\nDevelopment Status\r\n------------------\r\nInbucket is currently alpha quality: it works but is not well tested.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nYou will need a functioning [Go installation][1] for this to work. \r\n\r\nGrab the Inbucket source code and compile the daemon:\r\n\r\n    go get -v github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket\r\n    go get -v github.com/gorilla/mux\r\n    go get -v github.com/gorilla/sessions\r\n    go get -v thegoods.biz/httpbuf\r\n    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket\r\n    go build main/inbucketd.go\r\n\r\nEdit conf/inbucket.conf and tailor to your environment.  It should work on most\r\nUnix and OS X machines as is.\r\n\r\n    ./inbucketd conf/inbucket.conf\r\n\r\nBy default the SMTP server will be listening on localhost port 2500 and\r\nthe web interface will be available at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\nInbucket is written in [Google Go][1].\r\n\r\nInbucket is open source software released under the MIT License.
